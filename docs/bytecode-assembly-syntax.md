Bytecode Assembly Syntax
========================

Instructions
============

 * `rest <duration>` - Sleep for *duration-1* ticks then key-off for 1 tick.
    * CAUTION: A wait-rest chain should end with `rest 257` to prevent conflict with early-release.
 * `wait <duration>` - Sleep for *duration* ticks (no key-off).

 * `play_note <note> <duration>` - Play *note* for *duration* ticks then key-off the note
 * `play_note <note> <ko> <duration>` - Play *note* for *duration* ticks
 * `play_pitch <pitch> [ko] <duration>` - Set `VxPITCH` to *pitch* for *duration* ticks
 * `portamento <note> <ko> <pitch_velocity> <duration>` - Extend a slur into a portamento
    * Portamento instructions do not emit a key-on event.  You will need to slur the previous note before a portamento instruction.
 * `portamento_pitch <pitch> <ko> <pitch_velocity> <duration>` - Extend a slur into a portamento with a target `VxPITCH` register value

 * `play_noise <0-31> [ko] <duration>` - play noise
    * Noise is disabled on the next `play_note` or `play_pitch` instruction
    * CAUTION: There is only 1 noise generator.
       * In a song, this command will change the noise frequency on all song channels playing noise.
    * CAUTION: The instrument is used to determine the length of the noise.
       * If the instrument does not loop, the noise is played for the length of the instrument's sample.
       * If the instrument loops, the noise is played until key-off.
    * If a song channel plays noise at the same time a sound effect plays noise, the song noise will be muted.
    * If both sound effect channels play noise at the same time, an uninterruptible sound effect will have priority.
 * `disable_noise` - disable noise

 * `disable_vibrato` - disable vibrato
 * `set_vibrato <pitch_offset_per_tick> <quarter_wavelength>` - Enable vibrato
    * Vibrato will add or subtract *pitch_offset_per_tick* value to the S-DSP PITCH register in a sawtooth pattern on every tick.
    * *quarter_wavelength* controls the rate of the vibrato.
 * `set_vibrato_depth_and_play_note <pitch_offset_per_tick> <note> <ko> <duration>` - Set vibrato depth and play a note (vibrato rate is unchanged)

 * `set_instrument <name>` - Set the channel's instrument to *name*.
 * `set_instrument_and_adsr <name> <attack> <decay> <sustain_level> <sustain_rate>` - Set the channel's instrument to *name* and sets the channel's ADSR register (overriding the instrument's envelope).

 * `set_adsr <attack> <decay> <sustain_level> <sustain_rate>` - Set the channel's ADSR register (disables GAIN).
 * `set_gain <gain>` - Set's the channel's GAIN register (disables ADSR).

 * `set_temp_gain <gain>` - Temporarily sets the channel's GAIN register to `<gain>`.
    * The envelope will be restored on key-off.
    * A *gain* value of `0` will disable temp-gain.
 * `set_temp_gain_and_rest <gain> <duration>` - Temporarily sets the channel's GAIN register to `<gain>` and rest.
    * Sleeps for *duration-1* ticks then key-off for 1 tick.
    * A *gain* value of `0` will disable temp-gain.
    * The envelope will be restored at the end of the instruction.
 * `set_temp_gain_and_wait <gain> <duration>` - Temporarily sets the channel's GAIN register to `<gain>` and wait (no key-off).
    * A *gain* value of `0` will disable temp-gain.
    * The envelope will be restored on key-off
 * `reuse_temp_gain` - Reuses the temporary-GAIN from the previous `set_temp_gain*` instruction.
 * `reuse_temp_gain_and_rest <duration>` - Reuses the temporary-GAIN from the previous `set_temp_gain*` instruction and rests.
 * `reuse_temp_gain_and_wait <duration>` - Reuses the temporary-GAIN from the previous `set_temp_gain*` instruction and waits.

 * `set_early_release <t> <min>` - When playing notes, key-off the channel *t* ticks before the note normally ends.
    * The note will play for a minimum *min* ticks, unless the note is shorter than *min*.
    * This instruction uses less audio-RAM if *min* is 1.
    * CAUTION: The rest instruction in a `play-note rest` or `play-note wait rest` chain should be 257 ticks to ensure long notes are cut at the correct time.
 * `set_early_release <t> <min> <gain>` - early release with custom GAIN envelope
    * When playing notes, the envelope is temporarily changed to GAIN(*gain*) *t* ticks before key-off.
    * The envelope is changed a minimum *min* ticks after the start of the last note.
    * This instruction uses less audio-RAM if *min* is 1.
    * Useful for setting a custom release envelope.
    * CAUTION: the GAIN rate may need to be changed if the song's tempo changes.
 * `disable_early_release` - disables early-release.

 * `set_detune <i16>` - Adds an offset to the `VxPITCH` register in play-note and portamento instructions.
    * CAUTION: `play_pitch` instructions are unaffected by detune.

    * Volume slide is disabled on overflows and underflows.
 * `tremolo <amplitude 1..127> <quarter_wavelength_in_ticks 1..127>` - Tremolo

    * *amplitude* is the center-to-peak depth in volume units.
    * *quarter_wavelength_in_ticks* controls the rate (speed) of the tremolo.
    * Tremolo is disabled when the volume is set or adjusted.
    * Tremolo is disabled on overflows and underflows.
