==============
I would like to thank the following people, whose creations or assistance have helped me create the
Terrific Audio Driver:

 * KungFuFurby - for being a great sounding board and beta testing my audio driver.
 * Artem V. Ageev - for setting up GitHub CI
 * Near - for creating [ares](https://ares-emu.net).
 * Sour - for creating [Mesen](http://mesen.ca/).
 * Anomie - for writing *Anomie's S-DSP Doc*, an in-depth technical document on the S-DSP.
 * eggboycolor - for creating the [wiz programming language](https://github.com/wiz-lang/wiz).
 * krom (Peter Lemon) - for writing [a few SPC700 demos](https://github.com/PeterLemon/SNES/tree/master/SPC700),
   which helped me to learn SPC700 assembly and provided a nice example for how to access the S-DSP registers.
 * Douglas Fraker - for [creating and releasing a lot of free BRR samples](https://nesdoug.com/2022/01/27/why-b21-cents/#free-samples)
 * The people on the SNES Development Discord who have helped and offered suggestions when I wanted feedback or got stuck.

   feature was the deciding factor for choosing MML over writing a custom tracker.
