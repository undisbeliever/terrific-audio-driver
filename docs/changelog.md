Terrific Audio Driver Changelog
===============================

Version 0.1.0 (beta)
====================

**CAUTION**: The loader and 65816 APIs have changed.  If you are using a 65816 API, you will need to update it.

 * Added `#EchoInvert` header
 * Added global echo commands
 * Added `#MaxEchoLength` header

Version 0.0.13
==============

**CAUTION**: This release has breaking changes to portamento and early-release.
Please check all songs and sound effect that use portamento and early-release.


**BREAKING Audio Driver changes:**
 * Portamento effects are now processed immediately after bytecode.
    * The pitch now changes on the same tick as the `portamento` instruction.
    * Previously, the pitch changed 1 tick after the `portamento` instruction.
    * This fixes a bug in the MML `{}` portamento command,
      where (for example) `{c g}` played `c` note for 2 ticks, when it should have played `c` for 1 tick.


**BREAKING MML changes:**
 * Added optional minimum-ticks parameter to the `q` early release MML command.
    * two-parameter `q` early release is unaffected if the second parameter has a GAIN mode
      (`D` `E` `I` `B` `F`).
    * If the second `q` early release parameter is a number, it will be read as the minimum-ticks parameter.
 * Forbid raw GAIN in `q` early release MML command.


**BREAKING Bytecode changes:**
 * Added required minimum ticks parameter to the `set_early_release` instruction.
    * `set_early_release` instructions will need to be modified.
    * If the instruction used a GAIN mode (`D` `E` `I` `B` `F`) it will output an error
    * If the instruction used raw GAIN, it will erroneously read the 2nd argument as minimum-ticks.
 * Forbid raw GAIN in `set_early_release` instructions


MML Changes:
 * Fixed an off-by-one error in the portamento PITCH velocity calculation.
 * Added rounding to the portamento PITCH velocity calculation.



Version 0.0.12
==============

Bytecode changes:
 * Added note range tests to bytecode assembly.
 * Changed the bytecode format to increase the number of non play-note instructions from 32 to 64.
 * Added temporary GAIN instructions
 * Added `set_early_release` instruction
    * `set_early_release` can also be used to add a custom release envelope to channels.


MML changes:
 * Added bytecode assembly to MML
    * Syntax: `\asm {  }`
    * Bytecode instructions can be separated by `|` dividers or new lines.
 * Added temporary GAIN MML commands
    * `GT0` - disable temporary GAIN
    * `GT<gain>` - write the raw 8 bit value to the GAIN register
    * `GFT<value>` - fixed temporary envelope (0-127)
    * `GDT<rate>` - linear temporary decrease envelope (0-31)
    * `GET<rate>` - exponential decrease temporary envelope (0-31)
    * `GIT<rate>` - linear increase temporary envelope (0-31)
    * `GBT<rate>` - bent increase temporary envelope (0-31)
    * `GT` - reuse previous temporary GAIN
 * Added `Q%<0-255>` Fine Quantize MML command.
 * Added `Q` Quantize with temp-GAIN.
    * For example: `Q4,D10 c4` will expand to `c8 & GDT10 r8`
    * `Q<n>,D<rate>` - Quantize with linear decrease envelope (0-31)
    * `Q<n>,E<rate>` - Quantize with exponential decrease envelope (0-31)
    * `Q<n>,I<rate>` - Quantize with linear increase envelope (0-31)
    * `Q<n>,B<rate>` - Quantize with bent increase envelope (0-31)
    * `Q<n>,<gain>` - Quantize with a raw GAIN value (1-255)
 * Added `q` set early release command
    * The `q` command supports early-release with a custom GAIN envelope and is useful for custom-release envelopes.  
      For example, `q10,D16` will change the envelope to linear-decrease (`D16`) 10 ticks before a note's key-off.
 * Fixed portamento not quantized with the `Q` quantize MML command.


GUI changes:
 * Fix sound effects stopping at the first rest instruction.
   (This only effected the GUI, the spc700 audio driver was unaffected).


Version 0.0.11
==============

**CAUTION**: This release has breaking changes to the `rest` bytecode instruction, please check all sound effects.

**CAUTION**: This release has breaking changes to MML vibrato and subroutine calls, please check all songs.

   behaviour as a `{}` portamento after a loop that ends with a slurred note.
 * Fixed slurred note tracking at the start of a loop and after a `:` skip last loop command.
 * Fixed vibrato not disabled if a subroutine ends with `MP0`.
 * Fixed wrong MP vibrato state at the start of a loop (ie, `MP20,4 [a MP30,6 b]4`).
    * `~` manual vibrato loop behaviour is unchanged.
 * Fixed wrong MP vibrato state after a `L` set loop point MML command.
    * `~` manual vibrato loop behaviour is unchanged.

       * The sound effect will be reset if the sound effect is *interruptible*.
       * The `play_sound_effect` command will be dropped if the sound effect is not *interruptible*.
    * High-priority sound effects will ignore the *interruptible* flag if both sfx channels are uninterruptible.

 * Optimise saturating relative pan command into absolute pan commands.
   (For example, `p+200` is transformed into `p128` and `p-100` is transformed into `p0`.)
