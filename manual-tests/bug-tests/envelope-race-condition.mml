; There was race condition when changing the envelope from ADSR to GAIN in the
; middle of a note (or vice versa).
;
; This race condition occurred because the audio-driver wrote to the ADSR1 DSP
; voice register before the ADSR2 or GAIN voice registers.
;
; This can produce audible glitched output when:
;   * A voice is playing a note
;   * The previous GAIN was fixed
;   * The current envelope is ADSR
;	* The envelope is changed to GAIN decrement
;
; In this case the DSP could erroneously read the previous GAIN value for a
; single sample, changing the envelope to a fixed value and glitching the
; entire envelope.
